1. Predicts flight ticket prices based on selected parameters.
2. Frontend built with ReactJS and Tailwind CSS for an interactive user experience.
3. API built with Flask to serve predictions from the trained model.
4. Supports model retraining and integration with updated datasets.

#   Tech Stack
1. Python: Backend server and model training
2. scikit-learn: Machine learning model for prediction
3. Flask REST API to serve predictions
4. ReactJS: Frontend for collecting user input and displaying predictions
5. Tailwind CSS: Styling for a responsive UI
